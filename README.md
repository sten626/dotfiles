# Sten's dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles and configuration scripts to set up my own development environment on a new machine. I'm currently using WSL so that's what this is mostly for. Feel free to use this yourself but use at your own risk.

## Setup

To set up everything do either of the following.

- Run the following command which should handle everything:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/sten626/dotfiles/master/src/os/setup.sh)"
```

- If you already have Git installed, you can just clone the repository and run `src/os/setup.sh`.
